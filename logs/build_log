# Build Diary

## 07-05-25: Project Start
ğŸ”¹ Reviewing commercial coffee machines, single vs double boiler (very expensive)

## 14-05-25: Week 1
ğŸ”¹ Mockup specification drawn; pressure and temperature limits known
ğŸ”¹ Decision to use a 230V heater for a faster drink, then route with 24V components through SSR
ğŸ”¹ Lightweight component sourcing: SSRs, OLEDs, servos, arduino prototyping misc.

## 21-05-25: Week 2
ğŸ”¹ [Break: Focusing on Design Exhibition + Awards applications]

## 28-05-25: Week 2
ğŸ”¹ More detailed schematics drawn for wiring and hydraulics
ğŸ”¹ Boiling tank sourced; roughly 500ml, 304 Stainless Steel, 4 ports G1/4"
ğŸ”¹ Misc sourcing that includes glass fuses, thermal fuses, 24V/4A DC PSU, pressure/temp transducers

## 04-06-25: Week 3
ğŸ”¹ Birthday and a small holiday; project resumes
ğŸ”¹ Finalized component spec for solenoids and heater
ğŸ”¹ Confirmed wiring plan using 2-way solenoids only
ğŸ”¹ Decided against mechanical valves or steam wands
ğŸ”¹ GitHub repo created for everything
